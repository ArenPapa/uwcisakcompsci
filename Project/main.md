# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
The handling of several passwords across numerous government systems is one of the cybersecurity issues that the Japanese government is now facing. Workers often handle a variety of sensitive data, yet the current password standards have resulted in unsafe practices and inefficiencies. For example, a lot of workers are utilising risky practices, such keeping passwords in visible locations like physical notes or personal papers. This presents serious worries about possible data breaches and unauthorised access since these unsafe storage techniques expose sensitive data to hackers. In order to deal with these urgent problems, the administration is currently concentrating on bolstering security measures.

## Proposed Solution
In order to tackle the cybersecurity issues brought about by the Japanese government's poor password management practices, I suggest creating a personalised notepad application that serves as a covert password manager. This system would safely store passwords in the background while appearing to be a typical note-taking tool that employees are accustomed to using. 

Strong encryption techniques will be used in the notepad to safeguard confidential data, and it will automatically arrange and maintain passwords for several government platforms. Passwords will be easily accessible to staff members, eliminating the need for risky procedures like handwritten notes or unprotected files. This method ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations and keeps things simple enough for government workers to utilise, all while offering a highly secure yet user-friendly solution to the problem.

## Success Criteria
1. the notepad should be able to store notes.
2. the notepad should be able to handle errors.
3. the notepad should be able to retrieve the notes based by date.
4. the notepad should change to the password manager after the master password is entered [isak2026].
5. While in password saver mode the program should be able to perform the following actions:
     * Save: the user inputs the site and the password he wants to save.
     * View: the user can see the catalogue of sites and choose one of them to decrypt with the master password and view.
     * Delete: the user can see the catalogue of sites and choose to delete one of them (only when the master password is entered).
     * Update: the user can update an old password(needs to enter both the masterpassword and the previous one).
6. the program should store all the passwords in a safe file.
7. the program should encrypt all the stored passwords(Publiv Key Encryption).
8. the program should decrypt all the stored passwords when asked.
9. the program should work for infinite amount of times.
