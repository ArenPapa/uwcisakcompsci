# Basic Notepad with Password Manager

## Overview
This is a Python-based notepad application that allows users to:
- Add and view notes.
- Save, view, update, and delete passwords with RSA encryption.
- Generate random passwords.
- Store notes and passwords securely with a master password.

## Features
- **Notepad**: Add notes with timestamps, retrieve notes by date, and view all notes.
- **Password Manager**: Store, encrypt, and retrieve passwords using RSA encryption.
- **Password Generation**: Generate random secure passwords for different sites.
- **Encryption**: RSA key generation and secure password encryption.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays a sound to notify users when certain actions are performed.

## Requirements

### Python Version
- Python 3.x

### Dependencies
The program requires the following libraries. Use `pip` to install them:

1. **Cryptography**: For RSA key generation and encryption
2. **Colorama**: For colored terminal output
3. **Pickle**: Standard Python library for object serialization (already included with Python)

### How to Install Libraries
To install the required libraries, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install colorama
```

If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before running these commands.

### Resources to Download
Ensure the following files are available:

1. **RSA Keys**:
   - The program will automatically generate the necessary RSA key files (`private_key.pem`, `public_key.pem`) upon first running. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt your passwords. Make sure these files are kept secure.

2. **Optional**:
   - **`passwords.pkl`**: A file that stores the encrypted passwords.
   - **`notes.pkl`**: A file that stores the saved notes.
   
   The program will create both files automatically if they don't exist.

### Main Files
- `app.py`: The main script that runs the program.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or download the project files**.
2. **Install the required libraries** using the `pip` commands provided above.
3. **Run the program** using the following command:
   ```bash
   python Project1.py
   ```

## Notes
- Make sure to keep your **master password** secure. It is used to decrypt stored passwords.
- RSA keys will be generated automatically if they do not exist on the first run of the program.
